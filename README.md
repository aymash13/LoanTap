# 📊 LoanTap Creditworthiness Prediction

## 📝 Problem Statement
LoanTap is an online platform that delivers customized loan products to millennials.  
The company aims to build an **underwriting layer** to determine the creditworthiness of individuals applying for Personal Loans.

**Key Business Question:**
- Given a set of attributes for an individual, should a credit line be extended to them?  
- If yes, what repayment terms should be recommended?

This project involves building a **Logistic Regression model** to predict loan repayment outcomes (loan status) and provide actionable business recommendations.

## 📂 Dataset Overview
The dataset provided (`LoanTapData.csv`) contains borrower details and loan-related information.

### Key Features
- **loan_amnt**: Loan amount requested by the borrower  
- **term**: Loan term (36 or 60 months)  
- **int_rate**: Interest rate of the loan  
- **installment**: Monthly payment owed  
- **grade, sub_grade**: LoanTap-assigned grades for creditworthiness  
- **emp_title, emp_length**: Employment details  
- **home_ownership**: Borrower’s homeownership status  
- **annual_inc**: Annual income (self-reported)  
- **verification_status**: Income verification status  
- **purpose**: Purpose of the loan (e.g., debt consolidation, home improvement)  
- **dti**: Debt-to-income ratio  
- **credit history attributes**: (earliest_cr_line, open_acc, revol_bal, pub_rec, etc.)  
- **loan_status (Target Variable)**: Loan repayment status  

### Engineered Features
- **pub_rec_flag** → 1 if borrower has public record, else 0  
- **mort_acc_flag** → 1 if mortgage accounts > 0, else 0  
- **bankruptcy_flag** → 1 if bankruptcies > 0, else 0

## 🔎 Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data structure, missing value analysis, statistical summary  
- Univariate & Bivariate analysis (distribution, boxplots, correlations)  
- Insights on loan amount, installment trends, grade-wise repayment  

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Outlier treatment  
- Feature engineering (flags, ratio-based features)  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Scaling numeric features using **StandardScaler / MinMaxScaler**  

### 3. Model Building
- Logistic Regression using **Scikit-learn / Statsmodels**  
- Interpreting coefficients & feature importance  

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Classification Report (**Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**)  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Curve  
- Precision-Recall Curve  
- Tradeoff analysis (minimizing false negatives vs false positives)

## ✅ Business Insights & Recommendations
- Borrowers with **lower DTI** and **stable employment** are more likely to repay.  
- **Home ownership** and **higher annual income** correlate with safer borrowers.  
- **Grades A & B** are associated with higher repayment likelihood.  
- Precision-Recall tradeoff must be carefully optimized to reduce NPAs (non-performing assets).  
- For a safer lending strategy, focus on **Recall** (identifying real defaulters), but balance with **Precision** to avoid losing good borrowers.
